There are some TODOS and FIXMEs that we need to do on real production cycle:

 - Add Error Handler tests
 - Add integration with third-party test service if any
 - Separate test resources vs PROD resources
 - Extract test data to files
 - Add proper logging mechanism
 - Might need a security filter
 - Extract message to use play.i18n
